| [Wind Turbine Power Production - Machine Learning and Neural Networks approach](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project) | A web service in a Docker container that makes accurate predictions of wind turbine power from given wind speed, as well as Jupyter Notebook comparing three models, Polynomial interpolation, Decision Tree and Neural Networks. |
| [Wind Turbine Power Production - Regression approach](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project) | Two models, Simple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression, that make predictions of wind turbine power from given wind speed. Each model is implementated using NumPy and SciPy libraries.|
| [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Sorting-Algorithms) | An application to benchmark five different sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Quicksort, Heap Sort, Bucket Sort and Introsort, with a report introducing the algorithms and analysing their implementation and benchmarking.|
| [Dental Clinic](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Data-Representation-Project) | CRUD dentist / patient management web application built using Flask with a REST API and MySQL database. The application hosted online on PythonAnywhere. - http://olgarozhdestvina.pythonanywhere.com/ |
| [Shop Simulator](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Multi-paradigm-Programming) | Three programs simulating a shop employing C Procedural Programming, Python Procedural Programming and Java Object Oriented Programming, as well as a report outlining similarities and differences between the procedural and the object-oriented approach. |
