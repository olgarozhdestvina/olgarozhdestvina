## Olga Rozhdestvina
I am a student of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing Data Analytics at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) interested in pursuing a career in data analytics. 
I am well-versed in a wide range of programming, scripting, and query languages and web technologies, and am currently maintaining a 1st class honours result.

#### Machine Learning and Statistics 
_Module GMIT_
   * [Tasks](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Tasks), individual <br>
   The task assessment consists of four tasks covering topics on Machine Learning and Statistics, such as Calculating square root of 2 to 100 decimal places without using Python libraries, Verifying the Chi-squared value, Python analysis of standard deviation in Microsoft Excel: STDEV.P vs STDEV.S, k-Nearest Neighbours.
   *	[Wind Turbine Power Production](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project), individual <br>
   The project assessment consisted of building a web service that uses a machine learning approach to make accurate predictions of wind turbine power from given wind speed. For project enhancement I built and compared three models and wrote a Python script running a web service in a container based on the best performing model. 
#### Fundamentals of Data Analysis
_Module GMIT_
  *	[Tasks](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Tasks), individual <br>
The task assessment consists of four tasks covering topics on Fundamentals of Data Analysis, such as Outputting a dictionary of unique items with the number of appearance from a list without using Python libraries, Dice roll simulation, Flip a coin simulation, Simpson‚Äôs paradox.
  *	[Wind Turbine Power Production](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project), individual <br>
I developed two models, Simple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression, that make predictions of wind turbine power from given wind speed. There are two implementations of each model using NumPy and SciPy libraries. 
#### Multi-paradigm Programming
_Module GMIT_
  *	[Shop Simulator](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Multi-paradigm-Programming), individual <br>
The project contains three programs simulating a shop employing C Procedural Programming, Python Procedural Programming and Java Object Oriented Programming.  Additionally, I reported on outlining similarities and differences between the procedural and the object-oriented approach. 
#### Data Representation
_Module GMIT_
  *	[Dental Clinic](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Data-Representation-Project), individual <br>
Data Representation project where I designed a CRUD dentist / patient management web application Dental Clinic using Flask, a microframework for Python, with a REST API and MySQL database. The application hosted online on PythonAnywhere. - http://olgarozhdestvina.pythonanywhere.com/ 
#### Programming for Data Analysis
_Module GMIT_
  *	[Numpy.random](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/numpy.random), individual <br>
An investigation into the numpy.random package. It explains the package purpose, the use of Simple random data and Permutations functions, the use and purpose of 8 Distributions functions, the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
  *	[Dublin Air Pollution](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Air-Pollution-in-Dublin), individual <br>
Data simulation project of Air pollution in Dublin for a period from 7th December 2020 to 31st January 2021. The simulation was built on real air pollution data with 192 data points across eight variables. The project also includes investigation of the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. 
#### Programming and Scripting
_Module GMIT_
  *	[Fisher‚Äôs Iris Data set](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/pands-project), individual <br>
The project assessment consists of three tasks on analysing the Iris Data Set, such as outputting a summary of each Iris species to a single text Ô¨Åle, saving a histogram of each variable and a scatter plot of each pair of variables to png files. The program has a multiple-choice menu which allows selecting between viewing the text file with the summary, the histograms, or the scatter plots. 
#### Applied Databases
_Module GMIT_
  *	[Applied Databases](https://github.com/olgarozhdestvina/Applied-Databases), individual <br>
The project consists of MySQL-Queries, Mongo-Queries and PythonApp showing interaction with MySQL and MongoDB databases. Additionally, I analysed an employee database, evaluated its design, and outlined my findings in Normalisation.doc file.
